  It is the first antivirus program to use artificial intelligence to find and
  stop antivirus/malware in their tracks. Microsoft is working with it and Dell
  will be offering it next year!  Why haven’t you heard of it?   The company is
  currently focusing on enterprise level networks (500+ computers).  But we have
  recently created a partnership with Cylance that enables us to offer this
  amazing solution to you, today! •Cylance is far more effective than the best
  antivirus/malware systems out there. •No more daily antivirus updates!  •No
  more daily scans!   How does it work?  Cylance looks for 6.2 million virus
  indicators when it performs a onetime scan of every file on your computer. It
  will then run in 1% of your computer memory to stop new threats.  Cylance
  typically achieves a 99 percent catch rate.  Today, the big name antivirus
  programs brag about finding around 60% of these threats.
